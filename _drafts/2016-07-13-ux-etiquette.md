> UX IS ETIQUETTE FOR COMPUTERS

> A focus on appearance is just one of the ways UX is like etiquette. Both are the study and practice of optimal interactions. In etiquette we study the interactions among humans; in UX, between humans and computers. (HHI and HCI.) In both domains we pursue physical grace — "smooth," "frictionless" interactions — and try to avoid embarrassment. In both domains there's a focus on anticipating others' needs, putting them at ease, not getting in the way, etc.
