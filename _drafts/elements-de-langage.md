## Les miens

### Ma philosophie d'action :

- des sites simples -> simple à utiliser, utile pour leur visiteur (
  - "39% of shoppers in user tests failed in their buying attempts because sites were too difficult. This rate of failure could result in a loss of more than $6 billion for online retailers this holiday season."
  - NetSmart Research reports that 83% of web users have left sites in frustration due to poor usability. Unintuitive navigation and sluggish performance were reported as the main culprits.

Je ne fais pas des sites ou des applications, je créé des outils

Grandir avec les clients (je)

### Les projets sur lesquels je veux bosser : 
- ce n'est pas vous qui êtes ma priorité, mais les utilisateurs de vos services

37 signals: 
- le web devrait **donner du pouvoir** (empower), pas frustrer. "**We work with smart clients who understand that it's the customer**, not org-charts or office politics, **that matters most**. These clients are hard to find, so when we get them we treat them well."
- **We see people** : we think a successful site is one that makes **real people**'s lives easier (and not "users," click-throughs, hits, numbers on a spreadsheet)
- **Manager of External Reporting?** : pas de titres avec des bullshit jobs ("Front-End Technology Engineer")
- **Not full service** : Because we think companies that claim they can do everything actually excel at nothing. That's why we choose to do one thing and do it right. Oui maaaais
- **Size Does Matter** : We're small and we like it that way. It gives us the ability to turn on a dime, deliver projects quickly, and dedicate extraordinary attention to your assignment. Our size allows us to work on projects we want to do rather than projects we have to do. Plus we can all fit in one cab if we squeeze.
- We don't care about being the first to use the newest web gizmos. We believe in **being thoughtful and providing the simplest, best possible solution for our clients**.
- **Usability isn't enough** : Usability this, usability that. With all the talk about usability people sometimes forget the other "u" word, usefulness. You can have the most usable site in the world but if it doesn't provide a useful, helpful service, you're just wasting your visitor's time. And, when your visitors are frustrated, your competitors are their best friends. So please, be usable and useful.
- **ASAP** :At 37signals, we forgo the bloat and bureaucracy that plagues our industry. We don't have red tape or 5 layers of management. When you talk to us, you talk to us – not someone representing us. We're **sharp, efficient, and pay attention to the details**. It's amazing what a difference this can make.

# Règles pour choper du client 

https://clientgiant.us/jason-fried-s-13-unconventional-rules-for-getting-clients-69fbdb5584b8#.lo0ke65bm

## Sell your service like a product by removing the barriers and unknowns about what you’re selling. 
ok. Pourquoi pas un pack : site static 3 pages, prêt en X temps, pour X €. 
Pas de frais d'hébergement, juste un nom de domaine.
-> Jekyll
-> Options disponibles en + (formulaire contact, commentaires...)

## Make your portfolio about ideas not pretty pictures of your work.
-> cf Manifesto : https://37signals.com/manifesto

## Take a shot at being yourself.
Bin oui. Ca rejoint le manifeste.

## Don’t try to act bigger than you are, if you’re a freelancer use the word “I” instead of “we”.
ok

## Write and sell with short 1-page proposals. 
"all they care about is how much it’ll cost and how long it’ll take"
Hmmm... ok, mais ça sert pas aussi à consolider juridiquement le truc ?

## Think about what you can get away with NOT doing.
“holy shit, I don’t need to do what everyone else is doing.” -> hm, ok, ça ça viendra + tard

## Get things done without worrying about layers of red-tape.
Discussion d'un changement avec le client. Le mec fait le changement en direct et est acclamé. "but really, Jason just removed a layer of procedure that shouldn’t have been there in the first place"
Hm, ok, pourquoi pas.

## Hire yourself and be your own client.
-> créer ses propres outils (cf basecamp)

## Get a solid budget before you create a proposal. 
Everyone has a number in mind. Jason trick for getting this number was to say, “Oh, ok. So a $100,000 solution would work for you?” Clients would quickly reply… “Oh no, probably something more around $30K.” 

## Don’t work with bad clients.
ouiii autant que possible

## Know when to say no. 
Don’t be afraid to turn down work, a lot of times that’s less costly than taking on the wrong client.

## Hire your clients.

## Never work for a client so big you can’t afford to lose them.

## Only seek clients with a product or service you are proud of. 

## Only accept a client if you can improve their existing work. 

## Don’t take on clients whose business is dying.

## Tell prospects about your weaknesses.
you will also gain their trust. It will make you more credible when you boast about your strong points. 

## Beware of clients who have no budget but a great idea. 

## Fire clients at least 5 times more often than you get fired. 
Always do it for the same reason: if their behavior erodes the morale of the people working on their account. Do not allow this from any client.

## Use what you specialize in to find new clients. 
The trick will be to not just make thing that you like or impress people in your industry, but to make things that impress potential clients.

# Quotes

> The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
Edmund Burke

> Simplicity does not mean want or poverty. It does not mean the absence of any decor, or absolute nudity. It only means that the decor should belong intimately to the design proper, and that anything foreign to it should be taken away.
Paul Jacques Grillo
