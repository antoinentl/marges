"But there is a bit of a trap in venture capital. Once you start taking other people’s money, it becomes very difficult to stop taking other people’s money. So, you start by taking a little bit of money from your friends and your family so you can build a product so that you can go raise your seed round so you can show that people want to use this product so you can raise an A round to show that lots of people like to use the product so you can raise your B round so scale the team to build the product. And that’s kind of how venture capital works.

It’s this interesting cycle to watch as an outsider where the things that people are building, they are building for investors and not necessarily building for customers."

"We’ve create archetypes for entrepreneurs and narratives about ambition for what these Unicorns are supposed to look like. And, if you don’t fit the profile you don’t get venture capital because you have no chance of delivering that kind of return. So, you have entrepreneurs building companies, building customer bases, designing interactions with their users in order to make themselves appealing to venture capital."
